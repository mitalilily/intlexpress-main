# Amazon Shipping Postman Checks

Import these files into Postman:

- `amazon-shipping.postman_collection.json`
- `amazon-shipping.local.postman_environment.json`

Before running the collection, set:

- `baseUrl`
- `xApiKey`
- `amazonAccessToken` if you want to pass a direct one-hour access token

If Amazon credentials are already saved from the admin Courier Credentials page,
leave `amazonAccessToken` blank and the backend will generate the token from the
stored refresh token and LWA client credentials.

For end-to-end purchase flow:

1. Run `Get Rates`.
2. Copy `requestToken`, a selected `rateId`, and optionally `serviceId` from the
   Amazon response into the environment.
3. Run `Purchase Shipment` or `One Click Shipment`.
4. Copy returned `shipmentId`, `trackingId`, and `carrierId` before running
   documents, tracking, cancel, or NDR checks.

Per Amazon Shipping docs, `Access Points` is configured with
`AmazonShipping_UK`; `NDR Feedback` is configured with `AmazonShipping_IN`.
